#+TITLE: Lambda-x86 Project Notes

I've decided to build a quick-and-dirty compiler following _An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction_ by Abdulaziz Ghuloum. I can build a bigger compiler later.

* Tasks
** TODO Fix up parser to handle booleans
** TODO Fix up type checker                                         :discuss:
I wonder if there's a way to use the type information to make my assembler more efficient. (I bet there is; I'll leave that for an enhancement.)
** TODO Use type information to improve instruction choice      :enhancement:
* Resources
